### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<a href="https://app.daily.dev/cartman9999"><img src="https://github.com/cartman9999/cartman9999/blob/main/devcard.svg" width="400" alt="Eric Montes de Oca's Dev Card"/></a>



Let me introduce myself...
I'm a Computer Systems Engineer, bachelor from Instituto PolitÃ©cnico Nacional with six and a half years working in the IT sector, SCRUM Master certified, experience as a web developer, project manager and backend tech lead. Consolidated projects for clients from different vertical such as automotive, education, insurance and retail; prioritizing development time optimization, performance, scalability and client satisfaction; capable of understanding the needs of companies, helping to automate and improve their processes, achieving objectives, and generating added value. My experience as a Project Manager and developer has allowed me to acquire a global vision of projects, in which I seek to combine customer satisfaction, development time optimization and system scalability.

My biggest motivation is to be better every day, which is reflected in my work by staying up to date on recent technologies, methodologies, and frameworks, perfecting my skills, optimizing my algorithms, and learning languages.

I believe that technology should be used to help, so as a degree project together with two colleagues, I made a prototype of a device that translates voice to Braille in order to facilitate its learning.
